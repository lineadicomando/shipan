式盤 shìpán is the diviner's board itself: the round heaven turning on the
square earth, and the ancestor the three 式 — 奇門, 六壬, 太乙 — have in common.
Here it is a **pure engine** and **adapters** that expose it on a command
line, over HTTP, to AI agents, and in a browser.

Everything runs locally. No third-party API is called at runtime — not for the
ephemerides, not for the places, not for anything.

| Almanac         | 曆注: 建除十二神, 二十八宿值日, the 十二神, twenty-six 年神, the four 德 of the month and twenty-eight 神煞 — reckoned on 120°E beside the chart rather than inside it                                                                                                                                  |
| Choosing a time | 擇時擇方: every chart over an interval, narrowed to the palaces answering stated criteria                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It reports **arrangements and what the tradition calls them**. A gate stands
over a palace whose phase it controls; the configuration is called 門迫; 迫 is
oppression, so it comes back marked 凶. That last part is an attribute of the
arrangement, transmitted with its name in the same line of the same text, and
carrying it is reporting rather than interpreting — an engine that dropped it
would be editing its sources into glosses like "gate oppressed", where nothing
could test it.

What it does **not** do is everything that needs a question to have been
asked: it does not choose the 用神, does not rank palaces, does not order two
hours, does not date an outcome, and does not advise. A chart holding four 凶
configurations is not a bad time to do anything — bad is a word about an
undertaking, and no undertaking is known here.

Every refusal is written down, with who asks for it and why it is not here:
[`docs/refusals.md`](docs/refusals.md).

## Handing a board to something that will read it

That refusal has a consequence: somebody who wants a reading takes the date to
a model, and a model handed a date and a place casts the chart from memory and
gets it wrong. A wrong chart read well is the worst thing this project can
produce, because nothing downstream catches it.

So the board travels **already computed**, and the conditions travel with it:

```sh
shipan qimen --date 2024-06-15 --time 14:00 --tz Asia/Shanghai \
             --ask "Will the contract be signed as it stands?"
shipan bazi  --date 1968-03-12 --time 14:30 --tz Asia/Shanghai \
             --gender female --prompt
shipan taiyi --year 2026 --about "the merger our two firms are negotiating"
```

What comes out is the board set out in full inside a fence, wrapped in what
whoever reads it has to be told — that the reading belongs to whoever gives
it, that the fortunes do not add up to a score, that a 凶 is not advice.

**Six boards, in three kinds, and the kind decides what is asked for.**

| Kind         | Boards         | What it is laid on    | What the reader supplies                                     |
|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 卜 divination | 奇門, 六壬         | the instant of asking | a question                                                   |
| 命 fate       | 八字, 七政四餘, 紫微斗數 | a birth               | nothing asked; the themes are commissioned in the prompt     |
| 天 heaven     | 太乙             | a year                | a **matter** — what is being looked at, with two sides in it |

A 卜 board withholds the 用神 and says so: which palace bears on the question
is the reader's, and without one the board is a map with no pin. A 命 reading
traverses the themes of a life — temperament, tensions, the work on oneself,
undertakings, ties — with every claim standing on the board and every choice
said as it is made. A 天 reading is descriptive and never predictive: its
subject is a year, nobody is on the board, and 太乙's received dynastic
readings stay out.

`--ask` works on `qimen` and `liuren` and is **refused** on the others rather
than quietly dropped; `--about` is 太乙's alone and refused everywhere else.
Neither a question nor a matter ever reaches the server: over HTTP `asked=true`
and `about=true` say one exists, and the browser appends the text.

This project talks to no model, holds no key and sends nothing anywhere. The
prompt goes to a clipboard.

Full account: [`docs/readings.md`](docs/readings.md), and
[`docs/agent-prompt.md`](docs/agent-prompt.md) for what an agent calling this
has to know first.

### A birth inside a chart of a moment

`--born` adds a 年命: 本命, the year pillar of the birth, and — with `--gender`,
read for the direction of the count and nothing else — 行年, the year being
lived, each looked up **inside the chart of the moment**. The chart does not
move for it. That is 《遁甲演義》's own prescription and the reverse of a natal
chart: 「夫用遁之法，不推本命行年，未見精妙」.

What comes back is where the two pairs fell, the palace their branch moors in,
and the 納音 image weighed against that ground. Nothing more. The same pair is
a criterion for a scan — `shipan scan --born …` admits only the palaces that
person's year stands on. The doctrine mapping palaces onto parts of a life is
refused wherever a 年命 appears; an art natively about a life gets a board of
its own instead, which is what the three boards of 命 are.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run geo:import -w @shipan/geo   # ~215 MB, once
npm run build
npm test
```

The location import is the only slow step and is needed only for searching
places by name; everything else works without it, except the tests that
search. `npm run geo:fixture -w @shipan/geo` writes a four-place stand-in
in seconds — enough for every suite, refused if a database already exists, and
what continuous integration uses. The ephemeris files come from
`npm run ephe:download -w @shipan/core` (~2 MB) and are optional: without
them the engine falls back to Moshier, accurate to about a tenth of an arc
second, which is far below anything a pillar turns on.

## The surfaces

                --gate kaimen --towards se,s

npm run dev -w @shipan/web    # http://localhost:5173
npm start   -w @shipan/web    # http://localhost:3000, after build
npm start   -w @shipan/mcp    # MCP on stdio
```

Every surface takes the same parameters and answers the same way. A chart is a
pure function of its input, so a web address is shareable and reproducible:
`/it/qimen?date=1984-03-12&time=07:30&locationId=1816670` is a chart, a link,
and the same query string the API takes. It is also how the moment follows a
reader from one board to another and back.

**Every section is addressed by the art it lays out** — `/it/qimen`,
`/it/liuren`, `/it/qizheng`, `/it/ziwei`, `/it/taiyi` — and so is the endpoint
under it. The consultation is the one section with no art of its own, because
it takes any of them: it answers at `/it`, the root of a language, and
`/it/consult` and `/consult` are the word for it rather than a second address.

**A consultation is an act rather than an address.** The board is cast at the
instant it is asked for and holds somebody's question, and neither is in the
URL — reloading finds the fields ready, not the answer preserved. An address
that does not say *when* means now, and now is a different answer every hour:
those are `no-store`, and only an address that fixes the instant is cacheable.

**A place is a `locationId` from the search, or a `latitude` and a `longitude`
with a `timezone`, or an identifier refined by a pair of coordinates.** The
third exists because the search knows the town and not the hamlet three
valleys up, and the longitude is what the correction to true solar time is
made of: the coordinates replace the ones GeoNames holds, and the zone stays
the named place's. Only what *departs* from the chosen place is written into
the address, so the plainest question keeps the plainest address; where
something did depart, the answer says both halves — `Rome, Lazio, Italy · 41.8919, 13.5113` — because a sheet reading «Rome» over a board laid fifty
kilometres off says something untrue.

In this engine it is the longitude that moves a board. The latitude is carried
and printed and enters no calculation.

**Choosing a time is the other question.** A board asks what stands *now*;
`/it/moments` asks *when, in a stretch of days, does a thing stand — and which
way is it*. The direction is half of the answer, not decoration. Each row
links back to the whole board for its hour, and the hours worth comparing ride
in the address as a shortlist, so they survive a re-run and can be sent to
somebody as a link.

**And there is a printer.** A stylesheet for paper redraws the board in paper
colours whichever appearance is on screen, drops the fields and the switches,
and sets the nine palaces to a width that fits a sheet.

## Docker

```sh
docker compose --profile setup run --rm geo-import   # once, ~215 MB
docker compose up -d                                 # http://localhost:3000
docker compose run --rm -T mcp                       # MCP on stdio
```

`WEB_ORIGIN` is the address the site is actually served at, and behind a
proxy it has to be set: the canonical link, the `hreflang` alternates, the
sitemap and every social card are built from the request's origin, and nothing
in this repository holds a domain. Unset it defaults to
`http://localhost:3000`, which is right for a laptop and wrong for anywhere a
search engine can reach.

One image serves all three; only the command differs. The runtime image
installs `fonts-noto-cjk` on purpose: a chart is nine palaces of Chinese
characters, and without a font that can draw them the PNG renders a grid of
empty boxes — a picture that looks like a chart and says nothing.

## No school is implicit

Different schools produce different charts from identical input, so every
divergence is a parameter with a declared default, present in the input type
from the first release. The Qi Men chart's, in brief:

|                 |                                                                                    | default  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `method`        | 拆補 (the yuan from the day's 符頭) / 置閏 / 茅山 (the yuan from the term's first instant) | `chaibu` |
| `plate`         | 轉盤 / 飛盤                                                                            | `zhuan`  |
| `centreLodging` | the centre lodges in 坤, or in 坤 by yang dun and 艮 by yin                           | `kun`    |
| `trueSolarTime` | correct clock time to the Sun                                                      | `true`   |
| `yearBoundary`  | 立春 or 正月初一                                                                         | `lichun` |
| `dayBoundary`   | the day pillar turns at 23:00 or at midnight                                       | `zishi`  |
| `system`        | which family of chart: 時家, or the day's, month's or year's                         | `shijia` |

Each other board keeps its own, because each is a board and not a view of the
first: a saved one has to reproduce on its own terms. The full table, every
board, is [`docs/parameters.md`](docs/parameters.md).

Two of these are worth knowing before reading any chart from here.

**The three methods are three schools, not approximations of one another.**
拆補 reads the ju off the term in force and the yuan off the day, by where the
day pillar stands in the fifteen-day cycle headed by 甲 and 己 — the 符頭. 茅山
reads the same term and ignores the day: it counts five days from the instant
the term began, five more, and gives the rest of the term to the third yuan.
The two disagree about three hours in five. 置閏 follows the 符頭 through whole
fifteen-day blocks instead and pays the drift off with an intercalated 芒種 or
大雪, so around a term's edges it can disagree with both about which term the
ju belongs to, and occasionally about the dun itself. A zhirun chart names the
term its ju was taken from.

An unimplemented value raises `METHOD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` or
`OPTION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` rather than being silently substituted, because a
chart cast by the wrong method looks right and is not. A chart carries the
options that produced it, so a saved one reproduces identically.

## How sure the numbers are

Not uniformly, and the difference is worth stating. The solar terms are
published astronomy, checked against an almanac over 1 926 dates; the Qi Men
layout is consistent with two independent implementations of a contested
tradition, checked over 160 charts and over 266; the configurations come from
Chinese-language sources with no runnable reference at all; the 太乙 board is
checked against the text that states it and against nothing that runs.

**[`docs/sources.md`](docs/sources.md) holds the whole register**: every source
by name, what each was checked against, the licences, and — where two sources
disagreed — which was followed and why. It is the document to read before
trusting any single number, and the one to add to before shipping a new one.
[`docs/sources.tsv`](docs/sources.tsv) is the same claims as a table, one row a
quantity, each carrying the rung of evidence it stands on —
[`docs/notes.md`](docs/notes.md) is what a rung means.

**And none of that requires opening the repository.** `/[lang]/notes` is the
section of the site that says the same thing to a reader who came to check
rather than to read: what is computed layer by layer with every school
divergence under it, what each quantity stands on and how strongly, what is
deliberately not computed, what a school is here and what it takes to name one,
and what happens when a board is handed to a model. The first two are derived
from the engine and cannot fall behind it; the other three are written, and
every entry shows the day it was last checked.

Working from memory was tried and abandoned: recalled almanac values were
wrong more often than not, and the tests only became trustworthy once every
anchor had survived an independent check.

## The four kinds of string

English and Italian, English by default. But there are four kinds of string
here, not two:

|            | example              | where it lives                                |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| identifier | `xiumen`, `tianpeng` | the engine, toneless pinyin, never translated |
| hanzi      | 休門, 天蓬               | the engine — **domain data, not a locale**    |
| pinyin     | xiūmén, tiānpéng     | the engine — the same, said aloud             |
| gloss      | "Rest" / "Riposo"    | the catalog, keyed by identifier              |

The middle two are the ones usually got wrong. 休門 is not the Chinese
rendering of "Rest Gate": it is the name of the gate, and an Italian reader
wants to see it as much as a Chinese one does. And a glyph alone is, to
someone who does not read Chinese, a shape with no sound — it cannot be
pronounced, looked up, or asked about out loud. `xiūmén` is what carries the
name out of the screen, and it is a property of the name rather than of a
language: 休門 is xiūmén on `/it` and on `/en` alike.

A consequence worth having: the drawing is almost entirely
locale-independent, because the palaces carry hanzi. Only its captions, the
eight directions around its frame and what stands under it are text in a
language — a band of glosses, since 吉 alone in a palace would be a name with
no gloss; a band where every name on the board is said aloud, since the picture
is the half of this that travels and has no table beside it; and, under both,
the schools the board was laid by, for the same reason and with the same
force — a picture that said nothing about how it was cast would be the one copy
of a board that reads as *the* board of its instant.
