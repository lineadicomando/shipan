# stay in this stage — shared by the build and the development image — and

# time and fails outright when the file is absent. Copied whole rather than by

# directory, and a build that breaks the next time one is added is a build that
# breaks in CI and nowhere else.

# fonts through it, and with the files present but no index it behaves exactly
