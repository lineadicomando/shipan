/**
 * The section of notes is two pages derived from two registries, and the
 * failure a derived page has is not a wrong answer — it is a **silent
 * omission**. Both loads group their rows by layer, so a board the section
 * has never heard of does not draw a broken row: it draws nothing, and a
 * whole art disappears from the page that exists to list what is computed.
 *
 * So what is asserted here is coverage in both directions, and the messages
 * the templates build. A key like `notes.parameter.xiudu` is never written
 * out anywhere — the page interpolates it — so nothing else in this
 * repository can notice when a parameter arrives without a gloss.
