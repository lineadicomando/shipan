/**
 * The address of a scan, and the address of a chart reached from one.
 *
 * The chart's address used to carry the whole scan alongside its moment, so
 * that the chart section could offer a way back. It does not any more: the
 * board over the list holds the whole reading, nobody makes that journey, and
 * what was left was a dozen parameters nothing read. What is asserted here is
 * the other half of that — a row's `href` still answers on its own, which is
 * what a middle click and a browser with no scripts get.
