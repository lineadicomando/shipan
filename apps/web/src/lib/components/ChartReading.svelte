  A chart said in full: the ju, the nine palaces, the configurations.

  Everything the two places that show a chart have in common, which since the
  board came to the scan is everything either of them shows. It exists because
  they were about to hold two copies of it — and the copy that drifts is never
  the one being looked at.

  What it deliberately does *not* hold is the drawing. The picture is sized by
  the room its container has, and those two rooms are not alike: a page gives
  it the measure of the reading, a dialog gives it whichever of the window's
  two dimensions runs out first. So each caller draws its own board and hands
  this the words that go under it.

  The ju and the four pillars, as one block with a measure of its own.

  What the chart was cast from, and under a board it is the board's caption:
  the drawing sets its own caption centred over the grid, and these two do the
  same under it. Which is what the box is for — the ju is centred on the
  pillars because the two are one thing, not because a line of text was
  centred on a page.

<!--
  The four pillars of the instant.

  Not an addition to the chart: they are what it was cast from. The ju is
  counted from the term and the hour, the chief and the gate from the day,
  both post horses from a branch below — so a board read without them is a
  board whose every number has to be taken on trust. The drawing has carried
  them in its caption since it had one; the page had them only in the picture,
  which is `alt=""`, uncopyable, and unreadable to a screen reader.

  Drawn and not listed, everywhere the board is. Four tinted cells are taken
  in at a glance where a line of four pairs has to be read, and it is the form
  every calculator that shows this board shows them in — which is where the
  reader has met them. The plate asks the room it was given how many columns
  it can have, so the same four fit the page under a board and the column of
  the scan's dialog beside one.

  The pair and nothing beside it. What a pillar conceals, which god it is and
  where it stands in the twelve stages are the Four Pillars' questions, and
  they are answered in that section — putting them here would let a reader
  take a whole second method for part of the chart. The link under the board
  leads there, with this same instant in its address.
-->
<PillarPlate pillars={squares} {t} {wide} />

<!--
  The calendar the chart was cast from, and the almanac page it was read
  beside — named apart, because they are two relations and not one list. See
  `CalendarAndAlmanac`.

<!--
  Both post horses, never one of them.

  日馬 and 時馬 are two things the tradition names apart, and showing whichever
  one the software preferred would be a school chosen in a line of markup.
  Which of them bears on a question is the reader's, as the errand of a gate is.

  Guarded, and the guard is not superstition. A chart is cached `private` for a
  day, and the dialog reads one over `fetch`: a reader who was here yesterday
  holds yesterday's JSON, and the first thing a field added to the engine meets
  is a chart cast before it existed. Without this the whole reading throws and
  the dialog sits on «working» for ever — which is exactly what it did, once,
  against a response left over from before the field was built.
