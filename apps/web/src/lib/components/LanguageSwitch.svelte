  The code alone, because a flag names a country and not a language: `it` is
  Italian wherever it is spoken, and a tricolour says Italy, which is a claim
  about a place nobody switching languages is making. There were two marks
  here saying different things, and the one the eye found first was the one
  that was not true. The language's own name — what a reader would say out
  loud — stays on the label for anyone not reading by sight.

     shouted next to a nav set in words.

     Two letters are also a target eight pixels wide, which is a third of what
     WCAG asks a finger to be given and what the two marks beside them already
     carry in padding of their own. So the box is padded out to the minimum and
     the row is closed up by as much: the same two letters in the same place,
