<!--
  The board for one hour of a scan, over the scan that found it.

  A reader who has found four candidate hours wants to look at each of them
  and still have the list. Sending them to the chart section for that costs
  the list, and coming back costs the whole interval a second time — so the
  board comes to the list instead.

  A modal, and a native `<dialog>` rather than a box made to look like one:
  the focus trap, the return of focus to the row that opened it, Escape, the
  inert page behind and the top layer are all the element's own, and every
  one of them is a thing hand-rolled overlays get wrong. It earns the
  interruption by taking the whole screen for a drawing that wants it — a
  pane above the list had to stay small enough to leave the list somewhere to
  be, and was neither one thing nor the other.

  It holds **the whole reading**, and it used to offer a link to the chart
  section for the rest of it. The link was answering with a page load for
  something already in hand: `/api/qimen` comes back with the nine palaces
  whether or not anybody reads them, and this asked for it anyway to get the
  ju and the configurations. So the palaces are shown, and the round trip out
  to the chart section and back is gone — along with the way back it needed at
  the far end, and with the scan's parameters that used to ride in a chart's
  address to make that way back possible.

  Nothing shareable was lost with it: the open hour is `at` in the scan's own
  address, written by `pick`, and that is what somebody sends.

  What is genuinely gone is the stepper. From a scan there is no longer a way
  to the hour *next to* this one — which from a scan is nearly always in the
  list already, or absent because it answered no criterion.
