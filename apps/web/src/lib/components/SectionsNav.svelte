<!--
  Where the reader can go — on one line while there is a line, folded behind a
  button once there is not.

  Seven sections and two of them a phrase apiece: at 390 pixels the header stood
  three rows and 162 pixels tall before a word of the page began, and folded it
  is 90 with the wordmark still in it. The fold is the only thing on this site
  hidden behind an interaction, which is why the three notes below are about
  what it refuses to do rather than what it does.

  **It pushes, it does not cover.** An overlay would want a focus trap, a
  scroll lock, a backdrop and a `z-index` argued out against the seal that goes
  fixed in the margin at 88rem — four mechanisms for a list of seven links.
  `PlateDialog` is a `<dialog>` because it takes the whole screen for a drawing
  that wants it; there is nothing here to interrupt.

  **The button carries its word.** `Icon.svelte` states the rule at the top of
  itself — a mark beside a word and never in place of one — and three bars
  alone are exactly the control only somebody who already knows it can use on
  purpose. `nav.sections` is the word, and it is the word the landmark was
  already named with, so nothing new was added to the catalogs.

  **Without a script the fold is simply not there.** `app.html` writes
  `data-js` on the document before the paint; until it does, the stylesheet
  keeps the list open and leaves the button undrawn, which is the header
  exactly as it stood before. A button that does nothing would have been worse
  than no button, and rendering the list open and closing it on mount would
  have been a flash of the whole list on every load.

  What the fold does *not* say is which section is being read: closed, it reads
  `Sections` and not the name of the current one. Each page carries its own
  `h1`, at the top of what is below — that is why the wordmark above can stay
  the same on all of them — and a reader who wants to know where they are is
  looking at it already.

   *
   * Measured rather than chosen, and measured again once the names were cut.
   * Italian and not English throughout: `Scegliere il momento` is the longest
   * label of all, and the six instrument names are the same string in both.
   *
   * The eight labels run to 43.2rem laid end to end with every name cut, and
   * to 47.3rem at the widest — the 太乙 section, where the longest of the long
   * forms is worn — against 49.4rem when all six stood at full length. So the
   * list holds one row from a window of about 59rem up in the widest case and
   * 55 in the narrowest, where before the cut it wanted 61. Two rows is what
   * this header was always willing to spend: the note this replaced said as
   * much, and said it when there were three sections rather than eight.
   *
   * The widest case moved when 太乙 was given a long form of its own, and it
   * moved by a quarter of a rem: `Tai Yi Shen Shu` is one letter longer than
   * `Zi Wei Dou Shu`, which had been the longest. Five sections wear a long
   * form now where four did, and that changes nothing here — one is worn at a
   * time, so the count of them was never what this width was measured against.
   *
   * **No state of the list is wider than the row that stood here before**,
   * because a long form is worn by one section at a time: where 七政四餘 and
   * 紫微斗數 used to stand full beside each other, whichever of them is being
   * read now stands beside the other one cut.
   *
   * 36rem and not 32, which is where the third row used to arrive: at 36.1rem
   * the old labels stood in three rows and these stand in two, so the fold now
   * opens onto a list with room rather than onto rows that only just fit. That
   * margin is the part of this a translation spends. What the two forms cost
   * in exchange is a row that can rewrap on navigation, near the width where
   * it breaks; the alternative is holding the long form's room open under the
   * short one, which buys a still row at the price of a gap beside five labels
   * out of six.
