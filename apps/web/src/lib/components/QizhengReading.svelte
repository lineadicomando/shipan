   * A 七政四餘 board said in words, under the picture of it.
   *
   * Two tables and not one, because the board holds two frames at once and
   * neither is the other's approximation. The first is the eleven, each with
   * the 宿 it fell in and the degrees past that 宿's determinative star; the
   * second is the twelve palaces, each with the 人事宮 it took and whatever
   * came to stand there. A single table would have to choose which of the two
   * is the index, and both are.
   *
   * It takes the board as the API returns it. The client imports only types
   * from `core`, so the two standing notes and the phases are read off what
   * arrives rather than looked up: a value import would drag the ephemerides
   * and a native module into the browser bundle.
