  /**
   * A 太乙 board said in words, under the picture of it.
   *
   * Three tables. The first is what the year put where — the two eyes, the two
   * counts, the four generals — and it is laid out so that **the host's column
   * and the guest's are the same width and neither comes first**: naming the
   * two parties is the reader's first act, for the reason choosing a 用神 is,
   * and a layout that led with one of them would have made the choice.
   *
   * The sixteen are not listed again at the foot of it. They stand on the
   * drawing above, each in its own cell with its reading under it, and a band
   * repeating the same sixteen names in the same order was a legend to a
   * picture that had stopped needing one.
   *
   * The second is the sixteen seats, which is the ring the whole board is read
   * on. The third is the longer circuits — the gate on duty, the three bases,
   * the five blessings, the great circuit — each of which turns on a scale of
   * decades and is therefore the part of this board a reader is most likely to
   * be checking against a date.
   *
   * It takes the board as the API returns it. The client imports only types
   * from `core`: a value import would drag the ephemerides and a native module
   * into the browser bundle.

   * engine carries the number rather than leaving it to the reader for the

   * at `23` reads as a structure newly begun — a fact nobody computed. Written
