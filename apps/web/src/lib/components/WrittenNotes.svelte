<!--
  A written page of the notes: entries somebody keeps, each showing the day it
  was last held against the engine.

  The two written pages differ in one thing only — whether an entry names who
  asks for it — so they are one component and a flag rather than two files that
  would drift apart in their spacing and agree in nothing else. A refusal is
  worth stating together with who wants it, because a reader who came looking
  for the thing that is missing should meet themselves in the entry; a rule
  about handing a board to a model is nobody's request.

  **The date is the point of the whole arrangement.** It is shown, not filed:
  a paragraph carrying the day it was last checked is a weaker claim than one
  that does not, and weaker is what a written page should be beside the two
  derived ones. See `docs/notes.md`.
