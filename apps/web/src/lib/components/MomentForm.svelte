   * root: the group in the open and the fold below it are two items of
   * whichever grid the page stacks them in, and that grid's gap is already
   * between them. A margin here was that gap counted twice — which is nothing
   * much where three fields stand over a fold, and a hole where the open group
   * holds one search box and the fold is one small line.

   * a page, in two on a tablet and in one on a phone, and the panel they sit
   * in is free to be any width without this having to know.

  /*
   * The bound is on the row and not on the column, and it has to be.
   *
   * The three of them shared whatever the panel had, so on a wide page a field
   * for a date came out twenty rems long — a box the width of a sentence
   * holding eight characters, which reads as a mistake and is one. But capping
   * the *track* caps it on a phone too, and there a field narrower than the
   * screen is the mistake in the other direction. Capping the row leaves the
   * columns at `1fr`: they still divide whatever they are given, and what they
   * are given stops at a width three fields can honestly use.
   *
   * `min-inline-size: 0` is not hygiene here, it is what makes the cap safe.
   * `auto-fit` counts its repetitions against the available space, and where
   * that space is indefinite — which is exactly what sizing this row as an
   * item of the form's own grid asks for — it counts them against the
   * `max-width` instead. So the row's minimum became three whole columns, and
   * on a phone it carried the fields off the right of the screen. At zero the
   * minimum is the container's, and `auto-fit` settles on the one column that
   * fits.
