  /* The measure and the cells are `.reading` in `app.css`, which is what the
     two callers wrap this in. What is here is never being squeezed: six
     columns pressed into a phone break every name in two, so the table asks
     for the width its content needs and the frame around it slides.

     And the last column keeps to its own width, where `.reading` would give it
     whatever the page had left over. This is the one table on the site with no
     slack to give away — six columns of two lines fill the shell and then some
     — and the percentage would be a circular one besides: a cell asking for a
     share of a table that is measuring itself against that cell. */
