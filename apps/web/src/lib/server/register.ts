 * `docs/sources.tsv`, read into rows.
 *
 * **Imported rather than read from disk**, and `?raw` is what makes that
 * possible: Vite inlines the file at build time, so the register travels
 * inside the bundle and the built server has no path to a repository it is
 * not standing in. `readFileSync` of a path relative to the source would work
 * in development and fail wherever this is deployed from a `build/`
 * directory — which is the failure that would only appear in production.
 *
 * It stays on the server side for one reason: this is four columns of prose
 * and two of vocabulary over forty-odd rows, and the page renders it whole. Shipping it to the
 * browser as data would send it twice, once as HTML and once as JSON.
 *
 * The parsing is a `split`, deliberately. A TSV whose fields are guaranteed
 * free of tabs and newlines is not CSV — there is no quoting, no escaping and
 * nothing to get wrong — and `docs.test.ts` asserts the file's shape from the
 * repository side, so a malformed row fails a test rather than a page.
