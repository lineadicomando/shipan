/**
 * The instruments a consultation can be laid on, and everything that turns
 * with the choice.
 *
 * A consultation takes **one** instrument, chosen before the press and at no
 * point after it — see `docs/readings.md` for why that is the rule and not a
 * preference, and `docs/history/` phase 14 for the decision. What this file adds is the other half of it:
 * *which* one is a value, so that what turns with it is a field rather than a
 * conditional.
 *
 * **It replaced a boolean, and the boolean had begun to rot.** The
 * consultation used to derive `liuren = instrument === 'liuren'` and hang
 * seventeen branches off it — the endpoint, the key the board comes back
 * under, the drawing's measures, whether a birth is offered, which legend is
 * printed. Two of those branches read `width={liuren ? 900 : 900}`: a ternary
 * that stopped choosing anything when the two drawings came out the same
 * width, and that nobody saw, because at two instruments a dead branch and a
 * live one are the same shape. A descriptor cannot hide that — a column of
 * one repeated value is visible on the page.
 *
 * **A row is a board, and the fourth board was a row.** `docs/history/` phase 18
 * gave the consultation the instruments of 命 as well, and `needs` is the field
 * that arrived with them: a question, cast at the instant of asking, or a
 * birth, cast at the birth. It was left undeclared while both rows would have
 * held the same value, because a column with one value across every row
 * carries no information and no test can hold it to anything.
 *
 * **The fifth board was a row and a third value.** Phase 21 admits 太乙, whose
 * subject is a year — neither a question nor a person — so `needs` gained
 * `'year'` rather than the table gaining a branch. That the widening cost one
 * value in one column is the whole of the argument for the descriptor: at the
 * fourteen conditionals it replaced, a board that is neither of the two kinds
 * would have been fourteen edits and a page nobody could read afterwards.

   * enter it, so the whole of the form is one number, and empty is the year
