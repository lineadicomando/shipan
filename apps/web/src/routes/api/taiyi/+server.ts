/**
 * `GET /api/taiyi?year=2026`
 *
 * The 太乙 board of a year in the 年計: 太乙 itself walking eight palaces and
 * never the centre, the two eyes, the 計神 and 合神, the two counts and the
 * generals they seat, the 八門直使, the 三基, 五福 and 大遊, and the conditions
 * 卷三 of 《太乙金鏡式經》 names.
 *
 * **The one board here that is cacheable `public`**, and that is a property of
 * the board rather than a staging decision. Every other endpoint is a pure
 * function of its URL too, but the key of a shared cache would hold somebody's
 * date, time and place of birth. A 年計 board holds nobody's data: it is a
 * function of the year, like the solar terms and for the same reason — it is
 * about something everyone is standing in. It can be linked, shared and
 * indexed, and it is the first thing on this site that can be.
