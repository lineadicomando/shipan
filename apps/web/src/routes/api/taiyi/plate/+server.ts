/**
 * `GET /api/taiyi/plate?year=2026`
 *
 * The 太乙 board as a picture: the nine palaces with an empty middle, and the
 * sixteen gods on the border around them.
 *
 * **A grid and not a ring**, unlike the two boards drawn before it, and that
 * is a property of the figure rather than a choice of style: the eight 宮 of
 * this board are the outer palaces of a Qi Men chart in the same arrangement
 * of directions, so a ring would say they were the twelve 六壬 and 七政四餘
 * share. The middle is drawn and left empty, because 太乙不入中宮.
 *
 * It carries one standing line on its own face, and it matters more here than
 * either of the 七政四餘 board's: this picture will be looked at beside a
 * chart, and the palace numbers are one seat off the Luoshu's, so a reader
 * carrying the chart's numbering across gets all eight wrong with nothing to
 * warn them.
 *
 * Each of the sixteen is glossed in its own cell — the board is drawn at the
 * measure of a page, and a cell of it has room for the word under the name —
 * and the readings are said together in the band under the grid, as they are
 * on every other drawing here.
 *
 * `public` like the board itself: a 年計 board holds nobody's data.
