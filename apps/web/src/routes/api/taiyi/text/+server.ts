 * `GET /api/taiyi/text?year=2026&lang=en`
 *
 * The board said in words, in the form the CLI prints. Not a second
 * rendering: `taiyiTranscript` is the one the terminal uses, so what is copied
 * here cannot drift from what the engine's own surfaces show.
 *
 * `/prompt` beside it is the same board with the instructions for reading it
 * around it. This is the bare transcript, which is what somebody copying the
 * board itself wants — and it is what goes inside that prompt's fence, so the
 * two cannot drift.
 *
 * `public` like the board itself, and `vary: Accept-Language` only where the
 * address does not say `lang` — see `localeVary`, since a header nearly unique
 * to a reader makes a shared cache a private one with extra steps.
