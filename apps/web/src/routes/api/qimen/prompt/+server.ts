/**
 * `GET /api/qimen/prompt?date=2024-06-15&time=14:00&locationId=1816670&asked=true`
 *
 * The chart wrapped in what somebody reading it has to be told, for pasting
 * into an assistant that has no connection to this engine. It is
 * `docs/agent-prompt.md` addressed to a model that will never read it.
 *
 * **`asked` is a yes or no, and never the question itself.** A question is
 * somebody's own — *will the illness pass*, *should I leave* — and a question
 * in a query string is a question written into every access log between the
 * browser and this handler. So the frame is built here and ends on the line
 * that introduces one, and the browser appends the single line that must not
 * leave it. Without `asked` the prompt says plainly that nothing was asked,
 * which is the honest answer and not the same as choosing a 用神 for somebody.
 *
 * `born=1990-06-01` places a 年命 inside the prompt's fence, with the line
 * that says what it is not: not a chart of a birth, and no palace standing
 * for a part of a life. It sits beside a question rather than excluding one —
 * the birth is who is asking, and the chart is still the chart of the moment.
