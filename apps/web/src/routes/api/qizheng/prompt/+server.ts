/**
 * `GET /api/qizheng/prompt?date=1968-03-12&time=14:30&locationId=3169070`
 *
 * The board wrapped in the conditions for reading it, for pasting into a model
 * that has no connection to any of this.
 *
 * **There is no `asked`, and that is the whole difference from the two beside
 * it.** A board of 卜 is cast *for* a question and its prompt ends on the line
 * that introduces one; this is laid on a birth and nothing is asked of it. The
 * flag is not merely unused here — there is no line for a browser to append a
 * question to, because a question would name a seat this board prints. Somebody
 * writing «what about my career» has said 官祿宮, and a model handed the two
 * together arrives there without making a choice anybody could ask it to
 * justify. See `prompt.ts` and `docs/history/` phase 18.
 *
 * **And one board is in the fence, never two.** Sharper here than between the
 * other two: the twelve palaces of this board *are* the ring a 六壬 board seats
 * its 月將 on, so the Sun's palace on one is the general of the other. That is
 * one fact, not two witnesses.
 *
 * Phase 16 refused this endpoint on exactly that ground and the ground was
 * sound — it just does not reach the conclusion, since a consultation hands
 * over one board and the pair never meets. What had to be settled first was
 * different: this board arrives with its twelve seats already *named*, so the
 * prompt says outright that a name is not an assignment. `docs/history/` phase 16
 * records the reversal.
