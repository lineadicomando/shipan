 * `GET /api/bazi/text?date=1968-03-12&time=14:30&locationId=3169070&gender=male`
 *
 * The four pillars said in words, in the form the CLI prints. Not a second
 * rendering: `baziTranscript` is the one the terminal uses and the one that
 * goes inside `/prompt`.
 *
 * The oldest board here was the last to get this, and the reason is worth a
 * line: 八字 arrived as the substrate a chart is cast from rather than as
 * something anybody would hand over, so nothing ever asked it for a rendering
 * of its own. That it had neither `/text` nor `/prompt` when the other three
 * had one or both was an omission, not a decision. See `docs/history/` phase 18.
 *
 * `gender` is optional and only the decade luck cycles depend on it. Without
 * it the pillars are complete and the cycles are absent, which is the correct
 * answer rather than a degraded one.
