/**
 * `GET /api/bazi/prompt?date=1968-03-12&time=14:30&locationId=3169070&gender=male`
 *
 * The four pillars wrapped in the conditions for reading them, for pasting
 * into a model that has no connection to any of this.
 *
 * **There is no `asked`**, for the reason `/api/qizheng/prompt` has none: a
 * board of 命 is laid on a birth and nothing is asked of it, so there is no
 * line for a browser to append a question to.
 *
 * **What this prompt withholds is not a palace but an element.** A chart of 卜
 * refuses the 用神 and a model must choose one to say anything at all; here the
 * four pillars are complete and readable, and what is missing is the favourable
 * element — 用神, 喜用神 — which is the reading itself and which the schools
 * choose by different methods. A model will supply it unasked, because every
 * manual it has read opens by doing so. The prompt says the engine does not
 * choose, and that whoever does has taken a step of their own.
 *
 * `gender` only fixes the direction the decade cycles run in. Without it there
 * are no cycles, and the prompt drops the rule that bounds them rather than
 * naming something absent from the fence.
