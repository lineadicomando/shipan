/**
 * `GET /api/ziwei/plate?date=1968-03-12&time=14:30&locationId=3169070&gender=male`
 *
 * The 紫微斗數 board as a picture: twelve seats round the border of a four by
 * four, with the birth in the middle of it.
 *
 * **It is the figure the book prints its own tables in**, which is why it is a
 * grid and not the ring the 六壬 and 七政四餘 boards share. Those twelve are
 * stretches of the ecliptic; these are seats in a count, and drawing them
 * round would say the two figures were one thing.
 *
 * It carries no standing line, unlike the 七政四餘 picture. It did — that
 * nothing here is in the sky — and the line came off as something anybody
 * looking at this board already knows. What still says it, to the one reader
 * who does not, is the prompt, which opens on it at length: a model handed
 * twelve palaces with stars in them is exactly who would take them for a sky.
 *
 * `private` in a cache, never `public`: the address holds somebody's birth.
