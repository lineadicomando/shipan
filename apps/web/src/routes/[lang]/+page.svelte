<!--
  Where a chart is posed in order to be taken away and read.

  This project computes a chart and refuses to read it, which is the rule it
  stands on. The consequence is that somebody who wants a reading takes the
  date to a model, and a model handed a date casts the chart from memory and
  gets it wrong. So the chart goes across already computed, with the
  conditions attached — and this is the section where that is done properly.

  It exists apart from the chart because of an order the chart section cannot
  keep. **The instant of asking is the instant that is cast**: the question
  comes before the casting, or it is a caption on a chart that was already
  there. On a page whose address *is* a chart, whose arrows step the moment
  and whose empty address means now, there is nowhere to put a question that
  is not after the fact. Here there is nothing else on the page.

  One errand: a question, asked now, which is the classical use. So the form
  asks two things in the open — the question, and the place, which fixes the
  hour and has no default that would not be somebody else's city. The date
  and the time are under the options and empty, because empty is the instant
  of the press: a field nine readers out of ten have no business filling in
  belongs where the tenth can find it, not in front of all of them.

  **Three kinds of instrument stand in that select and the kind decides what
  is asked for.** The paragraph above is a board of 卜. A board of 命 is laid
  on a birth: nothing is asked of it, the moment *is* the input, and empty
  stops being the press because a birth left empty would be today's. A board
  of 天 — 太乙, and it is the only one — is laid on a **year**, which is
  neither a question nor a person: nobody is on it, no place and no hour enter
  it, so the whole of the form is one number, and empty is the year being
  lived. That last is the one place this page's original instinct survives
  into a kind that asks nothing, and for the reason it always had: an empty
  year is everybody's answer where an empty birth is nobody's. What does not
  turn with the kind is the rest of it — one instrument to a consultation,
  chosen before the press, and the prompt built here and nowhere else. See
  `instruments.ts`, and `docs/history/` phases 18 and 21.

  A birth may be given with it, and then the chart carries a 年命 — 本命, the
  year pillar of that birth, and 行年, the year being lived, both looked up
  *inside* the chart of the moment. That is the classical direction and the
  reverse of a natal chart, which this section offered once and no longer
  does: what a natal frame could honestly give a model was a warning, and
  《遁甲演義》 gives two pairs and the palaces they fall in. See
  `docs/sources.md`.

  Nothing here is in the address but the setup. The chart is fetched on a
  press and held in this component, and the question never leaves the browser
  at all: a consultation is an act, not an address, and a reload should find
  the fields ready rather than the answer preserved.

  **It is also the root of a language**, and that is a claim rather than an
  arrangement: the classical use of this method is a question put at an
  instant, and the three sections after it are the instruments that use serves
  itself with. What it costs is the chart's old address, and the note in
  `navigation.ts` says so.

  Two things can be done with what comes out, and they are the two the page is
  built around: hand it to a model, or print it. The second is why the answer
  carries the question in ink and not only in the fields — a sheet shown to
  somebody else has to say what was asked, or it is a chart of nothing.

        The column the fields are read down, inside a panel that is still the
        width of the page.

        The fields stop at 46rem — the cards, the question, the row of
        `MomentForm` — and under 卜 what stands open is a search box a third of
        that. Left where they fell, in a box of 72rem, they spent a quarter of
        the page on tint nobody reads, all of it down one side, under a right
        edge so ragged the page read as carelessly laid out rather than as
        fields that have a measure.

        Centred rather than the box narrowed, and that is the whole of the
        argument: this panel is the same object as the one on every other
        section, and two of those genuinely want the width — the bank of
        criteria on `/moments`, the steppers on a bar of `/qimen`. A panel that
        was narrow here and wide there would make the move between two sections
        a change of page rather than a change of subject. So the edge of the
        box stays where the reader last saw it and the room left over is
        divided in two, which is the difference between air and neglect.

        Its own gap, because it is one item of the panel's grid and the spacing
        between the fields is now this column's to keep.

          Which board this is, and it stands first because everything above it
          used to move.

          The question and the matter are not the same field: one appears where
          the other does not, they carry different labels and different
          placeholders, and under an instrument of 命 neither is there at all.
          Put over the choice, that made the first thing on the page the thing
          that jumps — a reader comparing two instruments watched the box they
          had just started reading appear, vanish and change name under their
          hand, and everything below it slide by two lines. **What turns stands
          under what turns it.** The order the section is built on is untouched
          by the move: what has to come before the casting is the question, and
          the casting is the button at the foot of the panel.

          Not behind the disclosure either, because it is not a refinement of the
          instant: it decides what is laid on it, and the boards answer
          different shapes of question. The options say what they are **for**
          and not what they are called — somebody arriving with a question
          recognises the shape of their own, where `Qi Men` and `Liu Ren` are
          two words they have no way to weigh.

          Six of them, and no longer a `select` nor a column of lines.

          A `select` gave one line to an option and showed one at a time, which
          held while there were two and stopped holding at five: a reader who
          knows none of these arts is choosing between descriptions, and
          descriptions have to be read side by side to be weighed. Radios in a
          column showed all six at once and only half solved it — six sentences
          stacked one under the other are still read *down*, and each of them had
          to carry the errand and the name of the art on the same line, behind an
          em dash, wrapping wherever the width happened to fall.

          A card holds two lines, so the two things stop competing for one: the
          name at the head of it — 奇門遁甲 Qí Mén Dùn Jiǎ, which is not a locale
          and now lives in `instruments.ts` rather than twice in the catalogs —
          and the errand under it.

          **The name is first in the order and second in the weight, and that is
          what keeps it inside the rule it looks like it breaks.** CLAUDE.md holds
          that what a reader operates leads in their own language, and an option
          whose face is a glyph is one nobody can choose on purpose. What that
          rule is written against is a card that says 太乙神數 and stops. Here the
          name is set where a kicker goes and in the quiet register, and the line
          in ink — the one the eye lands on and the one somebody is actually
          deciding between — is «come sta un anno, per tutti quelli che ci stanno
          dentro». Reading order says which thing this is; ink says which thing to
          read. A reader with no Chinese still chooses on the errand, and one who
          knows the six arts finds them where a list of six names is scanned,
          which is down the left edge and at the top of each card.

          **They are cards and not buttons, and the radio stays drawn on them.**
          This page has exactly one press and it is the one that casts the board;
          the instrument is chosen *before* it and never after. Six things with
          the air of the pressable, sitting above the one control that actually
          does something, would be six ways to wonder which of the seven casts.
          A visible radio says «one of these, then press» in the one vocabulary
          every reader already has — and it costs nothing, since the ring the
          keyboard leaves is then the browser's own on a control that is really
          there, rather than something reconstructed on a box that hides it.

          It is **not** the question field relabelled, and the two are kept apart
          in the state for the same reason they are kept apart here: a question
          asks what will happen and puts the person asking inside a figure they
          are not in, which is the one thing this board refuses outright. A matter
          names what is being *looked at* — and naming two sides of it is what
          lets the board's two counts be counts of anything at all.

          Required, unlike the year beneath it. That looks like this page
          contradicting itself and is the same rule one field over: what may be
          empty is what has an honest default, and the year has one — the year
          being lived. What the figure is read *for* has none, and a board of 天
          laid on nothing produces a precise description of a figure that never
          says «and so?». Which is what it produced before this field existed.

          A label and a placeholder and nothing else. There was a note under it
          saying the same three things a third time — not a question, not about
          you, name two sides — and the placeholder already carries the shape
          where the reader is looking when they start typing. Three ways of

          The moment, and where it stands depends on what it is.

          Under a board of 卜 what a consultation needs is a question and
          somewhere to stand: the hour pillar turns on the place, and there is no
          default for it that would not be somebody else's city. The date and the
          time go in the options and empty, because empty is the instant of the
          press and that is the whole use of this section — a field filled in for
          nine readers out of ten belongs where the tenth can find it.

          Under a board of 命 that reverses, and `when` is the lever the component
          already had for it. The moment *is* the input, so it stands in the open
          with the place; and empty stops being the press, because a birth left
          empty would be today's.

          The pair binds through `moment`, which is the slot the kind names —
          a birth and an instant-of-asking are different quantities, and a date
          typed as one must never resurface meaning the other.

          Under a board of 天 the whole component is **absent**, which is the one
          thing `when` could not express. There is no instant here to put in the
          open or under a disclosure, and no place either: a 年計 board is a
          function of a year, and a field asking where you are standing would be
          the page collecting a datum the board cannot use and the reader would
          assume it had. What stands in its place is the one number below.

        What reads a board is a component, and the four do not share a shape:
        one is handed the board and the moment beside it, one a chart that
        carries its own, one only the board. A registry entry naming a
        component would have to name the props with it, and a table of prop
        shapes is a conditional written sideways. It is keyed on the identifier
        rather than on a boolean, so a sixth board adds an arm and nothing else.

        Matched on the **board's** own name and not on `shown.id`. The two
        agree inside this block — nothing is cast without pinning the
        instrument beside it — but only one of them is the name the board
        travels under, and matching on it is what lets each arm be handed
        `chart.board` already narrowed to the shape that arm reads. The pairing
        stops being an invariant somebody maintains and becomes one the
