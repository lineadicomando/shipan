  /**
   * The 太乙 board of a year, which is the only page here with no form to
   * speak of.
   *
   * Every other section asks for an instant and most of them for a place. This
   * board is 太乙主天 and its subject is the year the world is standing in, so
   * the whole of the input is a number — and the whole of the address is that
   * number, which is why this is the first page on this site that can be
   * linked, shared, indexed and cached in public.
   *
   * That is why the fields never open into a panel. Everywhere else the
   * instant, the place and the school are a page of controls that withdraws
   * once it has answered; here there is one number, so what the other sections
   * are left with *after* they withdraw is the whole of it — a bar over the
   * board carrying the year, the two steps that move it, the way back to the
   * year being lived, and what can be done with the answer. A disclosure over
   * a single field is a door in front of a doorway.
   *
   * There is no prompt **here**, and that is now the ordinary rule rather than
   * a decision about this board. `/[lang]` is the only surface that builds one,
   * and since phase 21 this board is one of its instruments: a reader who wants
   * to hand a year to a model goes there, as they do for the other four. What
   * this section keeps is what every section that is an address keeps — the
   * board, its transcript, and the two ways out that do not involve asking
   * anything. See `docs/history/` phases 20 and 21.
