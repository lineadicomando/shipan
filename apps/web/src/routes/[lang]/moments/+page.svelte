  Outside the answer, like the strip that also opens it.

  It used to hang inside the branch that renders the table, which made a board
  something only a row could open. The board is a pure function of an instant
  and a place, and both are in the address: an hour set aside a scan ago opens
  the same way, whether or not the criteria in force still return it.

  What is worth guarding is not the *absence* of a place, which is an ordinary
  scan reckoned on the meridian of the zone, but an address that named one and
  could not find it: everything cast from that address is cast for the
  server's own zone — a chart of somewhere else, looking exactly like a chart.
  The scan already refuses; `placeLost` is how the board refuses with it.
