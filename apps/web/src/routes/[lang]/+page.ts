/**
 * The setup is loaded; the chart is not.
 *
 * Every other section casts from the address, because there a board is a
 * pure function of its parameters and the address is the thing worth sharing.
 * Here it is the opposite and deliberately so: a consultation is an act, not
 * an address. It is cast at the instant it is asked for, it holds somebody's
 * question, and it is not reproducible by reloading — which is what a
 * consultation is, rather than a shortcoming of this page.
 *
 * So what the address carries is the setup — the place, the options, which
 * instrument the instant is to be laid on, and the birth if one was given for
 * a 年命 — and what it never carries is the question or the board. Reloading
 * finds the fields as they were and the page uncast, which is the honest
 * state.
