 * Casting is loading, because the address is the chart.

 * link is not the chart the person was looking at and a reload loses it.
 * Reading the address instead gives the link, the reload, and the moment
 * carried from one section to the next, all from the same code.
 *
 * An empty address is not an empty page: it is the present moment, which is
 * the chart a Qi Men reader wants most often and the one every other is
 * stepped away from. The pillars cannot do the same — see `bazi/+page.ts`.
