      of the four columns above it. A birth three hours from 立秋 stood on a
      boundary, and until this line the page gave no sign of it.

      Without the almanac, and that is the component's own rule rather than an
      exception to it — see `CalendarAndAlmanac`. 曆注 weighs a day as the
      occasion of an undertaking; a birth is not one, and beside pillars read
      as a person the page would be read as a remark about the person.

      On the axis the reading is on, and that is why it is wrapped rather than
      set here as a sibling: it is the last thing under the plate, and one
      block of the three left at the margin is the one the eye reads as
      dropped. The component carries no measure of its own — it is laid out by
      whatever holds it, on the chart at the full width of the page — so the
      measure is the caller's to give.
