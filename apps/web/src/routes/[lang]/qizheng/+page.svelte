   * `auto` track is at least as wide as what stands in it asks to be, and a
   * scrolling frame around a table asking for 44rem asks for 44rem all the
   * same — so on a narrow screen the column grew past the page and the *page*
   * scrolled sideways, which is the one thing the frames were there to
   * prevent. This board showed it first because its tables are the widest on
   * the site, but nothing about it was this board's.
   *
   * `minmax(0, 1fr)` is leave for the track to be narrower than its contents,
   * and it is what makes the frames work at all. The consultation has said it
