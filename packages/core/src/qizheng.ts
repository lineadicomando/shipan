/**
 * 七政四餘 — the seven governors and the four remainders, on the sky itself.
 *
 * The third board here and the second of the 命 arts, and the first whose
 * quantities are read off an ephemeris rather than off a cycle. Where dunjia
 * turns nine palaces by rule and 六壬 twelve by rule, this one asks where the
 * bodies actually are and says which 宿 and which 宮 that falls in. Nothing
 * about it is a count: move the instant a minute and the numbers move.
 *
 * **The frame is the whole of the difficulty, and it is settled here rather
 * than assumed.** A longitude is arithmetic; the 宿 it falls in is a
 * commitment to where the twenty-eight begin, and the tables that state that
 * disagree because they were measured in different centuries. So the
 * boundaries are not tabulated at all: a 宿 begins at its 距星, and
 * `data/sefstars.txt` holds the twenty-eight stars for sweph to place at the
 * instant asked for. The 曆 remain as declared values of `xiudu`, for
 * whenever one of their tables arrives with an epoch that can be cited.
 *
 * **What it carries, and what it declines.** The twelve 人事宮 — 命宮, 財帛,
 * 兄弟 and the rest — are laid, and they nearly were not: they follow from the
 * 命宮 by counting, and no source consulted states which way the counting runs
 * in terms another could be held against. They are here on over-determination
 * rather than on two agreeing sources, which is the weakest ground anything on
 * this board stands on, and the check is written out at `HOUSES` for a reader
 * to run. What is declined is the step after. A palace is labelled here and
 * never read: the geometry is the 命宮, the twelve 次 the bodies sit in and the
 * name each palace takes, and the doctrine that reads a life off them is the
 * reader's, as it is everywhere else here. See `docs/history/` phase 16 and the
 * 七政四餘 section of `docs/sources.md`.
