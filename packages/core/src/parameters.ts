/**
 * Every school divergence, declared once: its values, which of them this
 * engine computes, and what it assumes when a caller says nothing.
 *
 * `docs/parameters.md` states the rule this file serves — no school is
 * implicit, so every divergence is a parameter with a declared default,
 * present in the input type from the start, and a value the engine has not
 * implemented is **refused rather than substituted**. What the rule did not
 * say is where the answer to «which values are implemented» is kept, and the
 * answer was: in five places at once. Each board spelled it out at its own
 * `throw` — `implemented: 'zhongqi'` — the table in `docs/parameters.md` said
 * it again in prose, `apps/web/src/lib/vocabulary.ts` said it a third time as
 * the list a form may offer, the CLI's help a fourth as the words after a
 * flag, and the MCP tool schema a fifth as an enum an agent is handed. The
 * only one of the five the compiler could see was the literal inside the
 * throw, which is the copy nobody reads. `docs/parameters.md` had already
 * drifted by a whole board.
 *
 * **A value moving from refused to implemented is one fact and is now one
 * edit here.** The refusals read this table, so a `false` turned `true`
 * without the code behind it fails the board's own tests rather than
 * answering with the wrong chart. The four surfaces above keep lists of their
 * own, because what each *offers* is a choice — a form and a tool schema name
 * only what can be computed, since an option that can only come back as an
 * error is not a choice, while the page names every declared value because a
 * reader weighing a school needs to know the others exist. What they no
 * longer keep is the fact: each is asserted against this table by a test, so
 * a list that falls behind fails rather than misinforms.
 *
 * **It is a description and not a validator.** Nothing here checks that a
 * caller's string is one of the declared values: TypeScript does that for a
 * caller in this repository, and a surface taking a value off a URL refuses
 * an unknown one with `UNKNOWN_IDENTIFIER` before the engine is reached —
 * which is a different error, meaning «no school is called that» rather than
 * «that school is not computed here». Both survive: an undeclared value
 * reaches `requireImplemented` as a value no entry matches, and is refused as
 * unimplemented, which is the true statement about it.
