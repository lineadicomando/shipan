/**
 * 太乙神數 — the third of the 三式, and the one whose subject is a year.
 *
 * Qi Men is asked a question and 八字 is laid on a birth. This board is laid
 * on neither: 太乙主天, and what it is a function of is the year the world is
 * standing in. Nobody's data enters it, which is why the section that shows it
 * can be linked and cached in public where a chart never can.
 *
 * Everything here comes from 《太乙金鏡式經》 (王希明, 唐, c. 730, 十卷,
 * 四庫全書本), read once for the domains of the gates and read again whole for
 * this. **The text states its own epoch and then checks it**, which is what
 * made this board possible at all: three 上元積年 appear in it, in three
 * different chapters and differing by millions, and all three are congruent
 * modulo 周紀法 三百六十 — the one residue every placement in the 年計 reduces
 * by. The magnitude is unsettled and irrelevant; the board is not. See the
 * 太乙 section of `docs/sources.md`, where the figures are quoted and the
 * arithmetic is done.
 *
 * **What it refuses is what the received doctrine is mostly made of.** The
 * transmitted readings of this board are dynastic — wars, famines, mutations,
 * dated — which is the class this engine already declines, arriving in a
 * register where it is more dangerous rather than less. And it never says who
 * is 主 and who is 客: identifying host and guest is the first interpretive
 * act the system asks for, and it is the reader's, for the reason the 用神 is.
 * The board names positions and numbers and stops.

/* ── The named conditions ─────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * The seven, each with what 卷三 says it **is** — where the chapter says it.
 *
 * `meaning` is the source's own characterisation, quoted, and it travels for
 * the reason `valence` travels: 掩 *is* 掩襲刼殺之義, named and weighed in one
 * line of one chapter, and it belongs to the configuration rather than to
 * anybody's situation. It is not this engine interpreting. Half of it was
 * already written down in the comment below this table, as the justification
 * for carrying the fortune; carrying the fortune and dropping the sentence that
 * earns it left a reader with 凶 and a glyph, which is an invitation to read the
 * character instead — and a model handed 囚 alone glosses it «a person in an
 * enclosure» with complete fluency.
 *
 * **What is quoted and what is not**, because the chapter gives both and they
 * are not the same kind of sentence. It states each condition three times over:
 * an 經曰 that gives the trigger, a 之義 or 者…也 that says what the shape is,
 * and then 若… and 嵗計遇之… clauses that say what will befall the realm. Only
 * the middle one is here. 「嵗計遇之，王綱失序，臣張君弱，宜修徳以禳之」 is a
 * dated omen with a remedy attached and is exactly the class this engine
 * declines; so is 「嵗計遇迫，人君慎之」. See the 太乙 section of
 * `docs/sources.md`, where both kinds are quoted side by side.
 *
 * Three judgements were made and are recorded rather than buried:
 *
 * - **迫 has no 之義.** What it has is a paired characterisation of the two
 *   distances — 「宫迫災㣲緩，辰迫災急疾」 — which says what each *is* rather
 *   than what will happen, and which the engine already distinguishes in
 *   `kind`. Carried on that ground.
 * - **關's line is 王希明's own**, not the 經's: 「王希明曰，闗之為義…」. The
 *   register says so; the transcript does not, because a name in every row
 *   would be provenance printed as content.
 * - **格 has a second clause**, 「若格太乙者，盜侮其君」, describing the
 *   sub-case where 太乙 itself is the body blocked. It is left out:
 *   `TaiyiPatternSubject` admits no 太乙, so the engine cannot tell that
 *   sub-case apart, and a sentence about it would attach to configurations
 *   that are not it.
 *
 * **對 has none, and the absence is the entry.** The chapter gives it a trigger
 * and then 「若下目相對之時，皆為大臣懐二心，君逐良將，兇奸生，下臣欺上」 — a
 * 若…皆為… list of events and nothing else. There is no sentence saying what 對
 * *is*, so it carries its fortune and stops. Where the sources say nothing, the
 * silence travels; inventing a line for the seventh so the table looked even is
 * the one thing this table must not do.

 * the sky rather than about a calendar: the counted year is the one whose 立春
 * the instant is standing after, so the answer is the year of the last time the
 * Sun reached 315°. Which is what `taiyiYearOf` says through the pillar that
 * was resolved against that same crossing; this asks the crossing directly,
 * because the pillar arrives with a place, an hour and three other pillars
 * attached and none of them are on this board.
 *
 * **Every surface has to answer «now» with this and not with its own clock.**
 * A 年計 board is a function of the year and of nothing else, so a page reading
 * the browser's calendar year and a command reading the pillars would lay two
 * different boards for one instant every January — and the one served in
 * public would be cached that way for a week.
 *
 * The crossing is dated in UTC, and the zone is not a choice being made here:
 * 立春 falls on the third, fourth or fifth of February in every zone there is,
 * so no zone disagrees about which civil year contains it.
