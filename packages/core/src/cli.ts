const HELP = `shipan 式盤 — the boards, on the command line

Usage
  shipan qimen     [options]     the 奇門遁甲 nine palaces for a moment
  shipan liuren    [options]     the 大六壬 board for a moment
  shipan qizheng   [options]     the 七政四餘 board for a moment
  shipan taiyi     [--year N]    the 太乙 board of a year — 年計
  shipan bazi      [options]     the four pillars, read out
  shipan ziwei     [options]     the 紫微斗數 board for a birth
  shipan terms     [options]     the twenty-four solar terms of a year
  shipan calendar  [options]     the lunar date of a moment
  shipan scan      [options]     every 奇門 chart between two moments

Options
  --date YYYY-MM-DD      default: today
  --time HH:mm[:ss]      default: now
  --tz  IANA-zone        default: the system zone
  --lat, --lon degrees   default: the meridian the zone is named for
  --year N               for \`terms\` and \`taiyi\`; default: the year of
                         --date. Under \`taiyi\` that year is the whole input:
                         the board is a function of a year and takes no place
                         and no hour
  --gender male|female   for \`bazi\`, where the luck cycles need it, for
                         \`ziwei\`, where the limits and the two rings do, and
                         for the 行年 of \`qimen --born\`. In all three it is
                         read for the traditional rule and for nothing else

Narrowing a scan
  --until YYYY-MM-DD     the end of the interval; --date opens it
  --for opening|meeting|wealth|documents|concealment|pursuit|ending|dispute
                         the errand, which stands for a gate and says which
  --gate, --star, --spirit, --stem   by identifier, e.g. kaimen, tianxin
  --towards n,ne,e,se,s,sw,w,nw      one or more; the centre faces none
  --min-strength wang|xiang|xiu|qiu|si   the weakest state admitted
  --without id,id        configurations that rule a palace out, e.g. kongwang
  --born YYYY-MM-DD      only the palaces the 本命 stands on — the year pillar
                         of that birth, on either plate. The other criteria
                         say what makes a palace worth standing in; this one
                         says which palaces are the person's
  --true-solar, --no-true-solar   default: on
  --day-boundary zishi|midnight   default: zishi
  --method chaibu|zhirun|maoshan  how the ju is determined; default: chaibu
  --shensha xieji                 which register the almanac line carries
  --guiren chou|wei               for \`liuren\`: which verse seats the 貴人.
                                  It moves the twelve generals and never the
                                  three transmissions; default: chou
  --luohou descending|ascending   for \`qizheng\`: which node bears the name
                                  羅睺, the other taking 計都. The default is
                                  the astrologers' law and not the 時憲曆's,
                                  which is the reverse of the Indian one
  --ziqi off|yinianyisu           for \`qizheng\`: whether 紫氣 enters as a
                                  fourth remainder. It is on by default and is
                                  placed to a palace and to no degree; \`off\`
                                  leaves the board with three
  --year-boundary lichun|dongzhi|chunjie
                                  for \`taiyi\`: where the counted year begins.
                                  It is upstream of the whole board, and only
                                  lichun is implemented — the pillars turn
                                  there, and a board cut elsewhere would be two
                                  calendars in one output
  --lang en|it           default: the environment, then English
  --json                 the data, unformatted and untranslated. Not with
                         --ask or --about: there is nowhere in it for a
                         question or a matter to be printed, and one handed
                         to it was silently thrown away
  --help

Handing a board to a model
  --prompt               for any of the six boards: it wrapped in the
                         instructions for reading it, to paste into an
                         assistant that has no connection to this engine
  --ask "…"              the question it is to be read for; implies --prompt.
                         Without one the prompt says none was asked, which is
                         not the same as choosing a 用神 on nobody's behalf.
                         For \`qimen\` and \`liuren\` only: \`bazi\`,
                         \`qizheng\` and \`ziwei\` are laid on a birth,
                         \`taiyi\` on a year, all four are asked nothing, and
                         they refuse it rather than dropping it
  --about "…"            for \`taiyi\` only: the matter the year is read for,
                         and **not** a question — a field of view with two
                         parties in it, which is what tells a reader which side
                         is 主 and which is 客. Implies --prompt, and every
                         other command refuses it rather than dropping it.
                         Without one the prompt reads the figure and says the
                         assignment was never made
  --born, with --prompt  the 年命 travels inside the prompt with the chart,
                         and the prompt says what it is not: not a chart of a
                         birth, and no palace standing for a part of a life

Placing a birth in the chart (年命)
  --born YYYY-MM-DD      for \`qimen\`: look the birth up inside the chart —
                         本命, the year pillar of the birth, and with --gender
                         also 行年, the year being lived. The chart stays the
                         chart of its own moment: this is the classical
                         direction, and it is not a chart of a birth
  --born-time HH:mm      default: 12:00. It bears on nothing but a birth
                         within hours of 立春, where it decides the year
  --born-tz IANA-zone    default: the chart's zone, for the same reason
  --years sui|turns      how the years are counted for 行年: 虛歲, counting
                         the year of the birth itself, or the turns of the
                         year pillar. Default: sui, which is the count the
                         rule was written for

A note on what this prints
  The engine reports arrangements — which gate stands over which palace, how
  a stem stands to the day master. What they mean belongs to whoever reads
  them, and nothing here will tell you. A scan is the same: it answers the
  question you asked it, and calls no hour good.
