   * The centre has no direction, no gate and no spirit, so what the ju puts
   * there is read at its host — which is why `chiefGate` and the flight of
   * the gates already pass through `lodge`. Without this the consequence was
   * computed and not reported: a reader standing at 坤 saw one stem where the
   * doctrine gives them two, and nothing in the chart said the centre lodges
   * here at all.
   *
   * **One stem and not two**, because under 轉盤 the turn runs along the ring
   * of eight and never reaches the centre: what the ju puts there stands on
   * both plates, so `palace 5` reports the same stem twice and there is only
   * one thing to lodge. Schools that instead glue the lodged stem to its
   * host and turn the two together get a heaven plate that carries it
   * elsewhere — a divergence in how the plate is derived, not one this field
   * decides. It is said here in the second place it is read, and not moved
   * out of the first: `palace 5` still carries it.
   *
   * **That divergence now has two witnesses and owes a parameter.**
   * 《奇門遁甲元靈經》 works two examples out in full; both agree with this
   * engine on the earth plate palace for palace and on the 值符 star and the
   * 值使 gate, and where the 符頭 stands in the centre the text carries its
   * stem and its star to the hour's palace — 「以中宮之癸加兌宮丙上為值符…
   * 又以天禽加兌」 — where this engine leaves them at the centre. The outer
   * eight agree either way. 《奇門遁甲金鏡寶鑑》 then states the same side as a
   * rule rather than an example: its 起星訣 stands the 值符 at 五 whenever the
   * hour's stem is the centre's, and walks 天禽 out of the centre through the
   * whole decade it heads. `ROADMAP.md` § 1 carries the debt and
   * `docs/sources.md` the collation.
