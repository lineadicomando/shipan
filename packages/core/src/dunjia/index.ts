   * the gates already pass through `lodge`. Without this the consequence was
   * computed and not reported: a reader standing at 坤 saw one stem where the
   * doctrine gives them two, and nothing in the chart said the centre lodges
   * here at all.
   *
   * **One stem and not two**, because under 轉盤 the turn runs along the ring
   * of eight and never reaches the centre: what the ju puts there stands on
   * both plates, so `palace 5` reports the same stem twice and there is only
   * one thing to lodge. Schools that instead glue the lodged stem to its
   * host and turn the two together get a heaven plate that carries it
   * elsewhere — a divergence in how the plate is derived, not one this field
   * decides. It is said here in the second place it is read, and not moved
   * out of the first: `palace 5` still carries it.
   *
   * **That divergence is `centreTravel`**, and it is not this field's: it
   * moves where the 值符 and the 值使 are reported and leaves every plate
   * alone. 《奇門遁甲金鏡寶鑑》 卷之一 states the two halves apart in one
   * clause — 「其星寄」 for the star, 「符使不必寄於二，徑排入中宮」 for the
   * moving pair — and 《御定奇門寶鑑》 lodges the pair out where that lodges it
   * in. Both are Qing imperial prints, which is what a parameter is for.
