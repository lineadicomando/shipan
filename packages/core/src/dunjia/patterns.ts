/**
 * The fortune a configuration is transmitted with (吉凶).
 *
 * This is **not** the engine changing its mind about interpreting. The line
 * it holds is between an attribute of the configuration and a reading of
 * somebody's situation, and the fortune is on the near side of it, for a
 * reason that is about the tradition rather than about the software: the
 * classical sources do not name an arrangement and then rate it in a second
 * step. 門迫 *is* 迫, oppression; 擊刑 *is* 刑, punishment. The name and the
 * fortune arrive in the same line of the same text, and a table that carried
 * one without the other would be reporting half of what it read.
 *
 * Which is why leaving it out never worked: it came in through the glosses
 * anyway — «gate oppressed» is not a neutral phrase — where it could not be
 * tested, sourced or contradicted. Here it can.
 *
 * What stays out is unchanged and is the whole of the doctrine that depends
 * on a question being asked: which palace is the 用神 for what somebody wants
 * to know, when the thing will happen, and what to do about it. Nothing in
 * this package ranks two charts, orders two hours, or advises.
 *
 * **How sure this is**: the third tier, the same as the configurations
 * themselves — Chinese-language sources with no runnable reference. Only
 * fortunes the manuals hand down alike are here; anything a school disputes
 * would be a parameter or an absence, as 三奇得使 is.

/**
 * 十干克應 — the stem above standing over the stem below.
 *
 * The whole table has eighty-one cells, nine stems over nine, and this holds
 * twelve of them. **The rest are absent on purpose**, and the reason is the
 * project's standing one: a pairing enters here only when at least two
 * independent sources name it the same way. Which sources, and what each of
 * these was checked against one by one, is in `docs/sources.md`.
 *
 * Two things the cross-check turned up, both worth knowing before adding to
 * this table:
 *
 * - **The pairing is agreed far more widely than the name.** Every source
 *   consulted marks 庚 over 癸 as a named configuration; the 煙波釣叟歌 and
 *   the Japanese tradition call it 大格, while one modern implementation calls
 *   it 太白沖刑. The same happens for 刑格 and for 戰格. Where the sources
 *   name a pairing differently, the classical verse decides — it is the text
 *   the others descend from — and the divergence is recorded in the sources
 *   document rather than silently resolved.
 * - **One pairing is here under a name its own witnesses disagree about.**
 *   庚 over 壬 was held out for a while as 小格 on one source; it now has
 *   several, and they divide over the couplet rather than over the pairing.
 *   The verse reads 加壬之時為上格 in the Wikisource recension and in the Qing
 *   engraving of 《奇門闡秘前編》, which also grades it — 上格，一名小隔，不宜
 *   出師 — where 《統宗》 and 《奇門遁甲秘笈大全》 quote the same line as
 *   加壬之時為小格. So the rule above, that the verse decides a name, meets
 *   its first case where the verse is transmitted two ways. 上格 is what this
 *   table carries and `docs/sources.md` says what it carries it against.
 *
 * 甲 never appears on a plate — it is concealed by the instrument of its
 * decade — so the verse's 丙加甲 and 甲加丙 are read here as 丙 over 戊 and
 * 戊 over 丙, 戊 being the instrument of 甲子.
