 * Under `chaibu` (拆補) the term is split into three parts of five days and
 * the ju is read off the term in force. The name means "split and patch", and
 * the patching is precisely this — the fifteen days of a term and the
 * sixty-day cycle of the days do not divide into one another, and rather than
 * carry the drift, this method re-divides the term each time.
 *
 * *Where the three parts are cut* is `yuan`, and the two schools that cut
 * them differently do not agree on most days. Under `term` the cut is made
 * from the exact instant the term began: first five days upper, next five
 * middle, the rest lower. Under `futou` it is made on the days themselves —
 * where the day pillar stands in the fifteen-day cycle headed by 甲 and 己 is
 * the yuan, and the term's own edge does not move it.
 *
 * Under `zhirun` (置閏) the drift is carried instead of re-divided: the yuan
 * follows the day's futou through the sexagenary cycle, whole fifteen-day
 * blocks serve one term each, and the accumulated drift is paid off by a
 * repeated 芒種 or 大雪 block. The bookkeeping lives in `zhirun.ts`; the
 * moment carries it, and this function only reads the table with it. The
 * two methods therefore disagree not only on the yuan of a given day but,
 * around a term's edges, on which term's ju the day takes at all.
 *
 * `maoshan` (茅山) differs again. It is not implemented, and it is not
 * silently substituted: asking for it is an error rather than a chart that
 * looks right and is not.
