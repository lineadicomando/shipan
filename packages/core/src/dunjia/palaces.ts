   * is the name of a seat and not a trigram; it has no lines to draw. Written

   * of eight, which it is not.

   * Written out rather than derived from `id`, because deriving it from the
   * Unicode order would bake in the belief that is being checked: the order is
   * asserted in `test/palaces.test.ts` instead, where a wrong symbol fails.
