 * again — 「朱雀下有元武。勾陳下有白虎」 — and needs no trigger at all: its eight
 * names stand in both dun and the yin board only reverses the order they are
 * counted in, which lands on the seats this ring lands on. So the disagreement
 * is not over which eight names exist but over which fact selects the middle
 * pair, and a parameter naming rosters would not express it. Two readers draw different boards from
 * the same instant and nothing in the output says which convention drew this
 * one, which `CLAUDE.md`'s rule forbids. Declaring it costs a field in this
 * board's input type; `ROADMAP.md` § 1 carries the debt and `docs/sources.md`
