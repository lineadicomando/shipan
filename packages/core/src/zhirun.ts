 *
 * Under zhirun the ju does not follow the term the Sun is actually in: it
 * follows the day's place in the sexagenary cycle. Days run in five-day
 * stretches headed by a 甲 or 己 day (the 符頭), and three stretches — always
 * upper, middle, lower in that order — make a fifteen-day block headed by
 * 甲子, 甲午, 己卯 or 己酉. Each block serves one term and takes that term's
 * three ju numbers; because a block is 15 days and a term averages a little
 * more, the blocks drift ahead of the terms (超神), and the drift is paid
 * off by an intercalated block (閏) that repeats 芒種 or 大雪, after which
 * the blocks trail the terms instead (接氣).

 * This is the contested pin of the whole method. The classical rule says to
 * intercalate when the 超神 has grown to nine days or more, which is read here
 * as a gap of nine, bounding the head to at most eight days before the
 * solstice and, the blocks being fifteen days apart, to at most six after it —
 * a window of exactly one block, so the head a solstice takes is never
 * ambiguous. Sources that say "ten" instead of "nine" shift the window by one
 * day, and a Japanese tradition that says "the futou nearest the solstice"
 * shifts it the other way; the three coincide except when the head falls
 * exactly at the edge. `kinqimen`, the one runnable reference, intercalates at
 * nine that way, and so does this table.
 *
 * **《奇門遁甲統宗》卷一 置閏法 counts its nine inclusively**, which makes it a
 * gap of eight, and its dated worked example over 1717–1719 intercalates one
 * day earlier than this. Every day pillar in that example is reproduced here
 * and the two part in exactly one cell — a solstice at position 8. The value
 * is left at 8 because one text against one runnable reference is one against
 * one; `docs/sources.md` § 置閏 has the whole of it, and this is the first
 * thing to reopen if a second witness turns up.

/**
 * Assigns a day to its term under the 置閏 method.
 *
 * `day` is the Julian Day Number the day pillar was read from — the futou is
 * a fact about the day pillar, so it follows the same reckoning, whatever
 * `dayBoundary` and `trueSolarTime` made of it. The solstices are placed on
 * civil days through `dayOf`, in the chart's own zone: the bookkeeping runs
 * on the chart's calendar exactly as the day pillar does, which keeps the
 * chart consistent with itself and means a chart far from 120°E can turn a
 * page one civil day away from the Chinese almanac.
 *
 * The assignment needs no history. Pinning each solstice's block inside its
 * one-block window fixes every block between two consecutive solstices:
 * twelve blocks serve the twelve terms in order, and a thirteenth, when the
 * window forces one, is the intercalation — it repeats the term before the
 * solstice, 芒種 or 大雪.
 *
 * **Where the repeated block goes is itself contested, and this is one side of
 * it.** 《奇門遁甲統宗》卷一 puts it at the solstices and works it by date;
 * 《奇門遁甲金鏡寶鑑》卷之一 repeats instead whichever term the year's *leap
 * month* falls under, works that twice by date, and calls the solstice
 * placement 「於理法都不是」 — a convenience adopted because the leap month was
 * hard to reckon. That is a divergence between practitioners and `method` has
 * no name for it: 置閏 means the 統宗's placement here without saying so.
 * `docs/sources.md` § 置閏 has both, and `ROADMAP.md` § 1 carries the debt.
