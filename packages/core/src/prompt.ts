/**
 * The chart handed to somebody who will read it, with what they have to know.
 *
 * This engine computes a chart and refuses to read it, which is the rule it
 * is built on and not a missing feature. The consequence is that whoever
 * wants a reading takes the date to a model — and a model given a date and a
 * place casts the chart from memory and gets it wrong. A wrong chart read
 * well is the worst thing this project can produce, because nothing
 * downstream can catch it: it looks exactly like a right one.
 *
 * So the chart travels already computed, and the conditions travel with it.
 * `readingPrompt` is `docs/agent-prompt.md` said to a model that has no MCP
 * connection and no documentation — the 用神 is the reader's, the fortunes do
 * not add up to a score, a 凶 is not advice, and the reading belongs to
 * whoever gives it. Handing over the chart without that would be this
 * project outsourcing in one paragraph what it declines to do in code.
 *
 * It builds readable text from a `Translator`, exactly as `format.ts` does
 * and for the same reason: the surface chooses the language, the engine holds
 * no catalog and decides nothing about who is reading.
 *
 * **There are six boards and there is one in a prompt.** Not because a reader
 * could not hold two, but because a model given two will merge them into a
 * verdict no text licenses, and — worse — will read their agreement as
 * corroboration when they overlap. And five of the six overlap everywhere:
 * the chart and the 六壬 board share the day pillar, the decade, the void
 * branches and five of the eight spirits; the twelve palaces of a 七政四餘
 * board *are* the ring the 六壬 generals are seated on, and the twelve seats
 * of a 紫微斗數 board are laid against that ring too, with their 四化 taken off
 * the year stem and their 五行局 cut by a 納音; and a 八字 is the four pillars
 * every one of the other four is laid from. Where two agree it is
 * frequently one fact printed twice. So the functions below never meet: a
 * consultation takes one instrument, and comparing instruments happens where
 * nothing is being asked. The rule is `docs/readings.md`; the decisions are
 * `docs/history/` phases 14 and 18.
 *
 * **This paragraph counts, so a board that lands makes it wrong.** It said
 * five while there were six, having been written when there were four, and
 * the number is what the argument rests on rather than a detail beside it.
 *
 * **太乙 overlaps none of them, and the rule holds for it anyway.** Its subject
 * is a year and it shares not one quantity with the other five, so the
 * duplicate-fact argument does not reach it — what does reach it is the first
 * half: a model handed a board of a year beside a board of a person will read
 * the year onto the person, which is the whole of what `prompt.taiyi.notPersonal`
 * exists to forbid, and putting the two in one fence would be this file
 * inviting it.
 *
 * **Three kinds, not two.** A board of 卜 is cast for a question and the prompt
 * ends on the line that introduces one. A board of 命 is laid on a birth,
 * nothing is asked of it, and the prompt ends on what to do with it instead —
 * which is also why `MingReadingRequest` has no `question` field to leave
 * empty. A board of 天 — 太乙, and it is the only one — is laid on a year,
 * nothing is asked of it either, and its subject is nobody: it ends on its own
 * closing, and the thing it has to be stopped from becoming is not a verdict
 * but a forecast. See `docs/history/` phase 21.
