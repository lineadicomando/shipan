 * failure this suite exists to make loud. What is asserted is the facts a
 * reader looks up: that every parameter is named, that its values are listed,
 * and that the default written down is the default the engine ships.
 *
 * What is deliberately **not** asserted is the prose. A row may argue what a
 * value names, in whatever words the page finds; the test reads the row for
 * the identifiers in it and leaves the sentence alone. A test that held the
 * documentation to a shape would be a page written for its test.
