/**
 * The Liu Ren board, drawn the way the tradition prints it.
 *
 * Not a grid of nine. The 六壬 board is a **ring of twelve**: the branches sit
 * round the edge of a square four cells to a side, and the twelve perimeter
 * cells are the twelve palaces of the 地盤 — which never move. What moves is
 * what stands over them, so each cell carries three things stacked: the
 * general on top, the 天盤 branch large in the middle, and the palace's own
 * branch small underneath, faint, because it is the ground and not the news.
 *
 * The ring is not a decision this file made. 巳午未申 across the top, 亥子丑寅
 * across the bottom, 辰卯 and 酉戌 down the sides: that is the arrangement
 * every printed 課式 uses, and it puts the south at the top like the compass
 * on the other board in this package.
 *
 * Above it stand the two things drawn *from* the ring — the four lessons,
 * written right to left as the tradition writes them, and the three
 * transmissions, read downwards. The middle of the ring is left for what the
 * board turned out to be: the rule that drew the transmissions and the name of
 * the shape.
 *
 * Like the chart, it holds no catalog and knows no language. Words arrive
 * already chosen.
