/**
 * The 紫微斗數 board: twelve seats round the edge of a four by four, and the
 * birth in the middle of it.
 *
 * **It is a grid and not the ring of twelve, and that is the drawing's whole
 * argument.** Six and 七政四餘 share a ring because their twelve palaces are
 * the same twelve — thirty-degree stretches of the ecliptic under the branches
 * that name them. These twelve are not those: they are seats in a count, and
 * nothing on this board has a position in the sky at all. Drawing them round
 * would say the two figures were one thing, which `docs/sources.md` spends a
 * subsection denying.
 *
 * **The four by four is the book's own figure, not a convenience.** 卷二
 * prints its five tables of 紫微 as exactly this diagram — twelve branches
 * round the border of a four by four, 寅 at the lower left, the middle open
 * for a caption — and the boards of every practitioner since are laid the same
 * way. Reproducing it is the one layout decision here that needs no argument
 * beyond pointing at the source.
 *
 * **The branches are fixed and the palaces fall where they fall.** A reader
 * looks up a seat by its ground, not by its number, so 寅 is always the same
 * corner and 命宮 moves. That costs the reading order, which runs *backwards*
 * round this ring — 命宮, 兄弟, 妻妾 — and a grid cannot show a direction. So
 * the order is written into the cells: each carries its palace's name, and the
 * name is what the order is made of. A reader following the twelve in
 * sequence walks anticlockwise and can see that they do.
 *
 * **The middle is full, and that parts it from the 太乙 grid it resembles.**
 * There the emptiness is content — 太乙不入中宮 — and filling it would answer
 * a question the method refuses. Here the centre is where the board says what
 * it was laid on: the birth, the bureau, and the two masters. A board of 命
 * has a subject, and the subject goes in the middle.
 *
 * **The cells are tinted by phase and the names are inked by theirs, and that
 * is a reading rather than a decoration.** 卷二 does not merely file each star
 * under a phase; it says what to do with the filing —
 * 「星曜全明生剋制化之機，**次看落於何宮**，如廉貞屬火在寅宮，乃木鄉能生
 * 廉貞之火」 — read the star's phase against the phase of the *palace it fell
 * in*, and the palace's phase is its branch's. The book calls that phase the
 * palace's 鄉, its country, which is what a tint depicts; and it closes with
 * the table of what is checked: 「金入火鄉，火入水鄉，水入土鄉，土入木鄉，
 * 俱為受制」. So a reader meeting 廉貞 in fire ink on a wood-tinted 寅 sees
 * 木生火 without looking anything up, which is the operation the 太微賦 opens
 * the whole art with: 「辨生剋制化，以定窮通」.
 *
 * This is the argument the Qi Men chart colours its stems on, arriving in a
 * second art: a stem *is* its phase, and so is a star here. Sixteen names are
 * inked and three are not — 天同, 貪狼 and 七殺 carry two phases apiece and a
 * glyph has one colour, so those take none rather than the drawing picking —
 * and neither do the thirteen the book passes over in silence.
 *
 * A cell can hold eleven names with a grade and a transformation on each,
 * which is denser than anything else drawn here, so the star lines shrink with
 * the count rather than the cell growing with it. What never shrinks is the
 * seat's own name and its ground: those two are how a reader finds the cell.
 *
 * **One word to a cell, and it goes under the star that leads it.** This board
 * sets forty names in twelve squares and cannot gloss them where they stand:
 * a word under each would want eighteen line-slots in a cell that holds
 * twelve, and everything on the sheet would shrink to make room for text
 * nobody could read. So the cell says one thing in the reader's language —
 * the leading star — and the band beneath says the other thirty-nine.
 *
 * **The leading star is the seat's principal star, and that is an invariant
 * rather than a hope.** The stars are seated in the order they are placed:
 * 紫微's chain, then 天府's, then the auxiliaries. So wherever a seat holds
 * any of the 十四主星, the first in its list is one of them — measured over
 * 4,608 seats without an exception. Where a seat holds none it is a 空宮, read
 * through the palace opposite, and it correctly shows no word at all.
 *
 * The word is set at the ratio the 太乙 grid uses for the same job, and it is
 * dropped rather than set below about eight pixels: in the three seats in a
 * hundred that crowd past it, a Latin line at that size costs the glyphs their
 * room and gives nothing back.
 *
 * Like the other four it holds no catalog and knows no language. The caller
 * supplies the captions already translated.
 */

/**
 * How much of a name's line a gloss under it takes.

 * Two thirds: the word is set at about half the size of the name it belongs
