 * the CJK ones by themselves and leading with Latin costs the drawing
 * nothing. The first four are the page's own, in `app.css`, so a board and
 * the prose around it are set alike; the three after them are what a Linux
 * renderer actually holds, and without them the stack falls straight back
 * into the fault the order exists to fix.
 *
 * Among the CJK families the serifs come first because the chart reads better
 * in one, and the sans families follow because a bare `fonts-noto-cjk`
 * installs those — a stack that named only the serifs would fall through to a
