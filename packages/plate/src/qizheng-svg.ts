/**
 * The 七政四餘 board: eleven positions on a ring of twelve.
 *
 * The ring is the 六壬 board's, cell for cell — 巳午未申 across the top,
 * 亥子丑寅 across the foot — and that is not a borrowing but the same object:
 * twelve thirty-degree stretches of the ecliptic under the branches that name
 * them. Where the two drawings part is what stands on the ring. A 六壬 board
 * turns one thing over each palace and this one lets the sky fall where it
 * falls, so a palace here holds nothing on most mornings and four bodies on
 * some.
 *
 * **That crowding is what settles the layout.** Every other drawing in this
 * package gives each register a fixed place and a word under it; here the
 * count per palace is not known until the sky is asked, and a gloss under
 * each of four bodies in one cell has nowhere to go. So the eleven are
 * *listed* above the ring instead — glossed, with the 宿 and the 入宿度 each
 * one fell on, and 順 or 逆 — and the ring below carries their glyphs alone.
 * A glyph may stand unglossed where it is repeated from somewhere it was
 * glossed a moment before; that is the same bargain the 六壬 ring strikes
 * with the branch of its ground, and the chart's compass ring with the eight
 * directions.
 *
 * The middle of the ring holds the 命宮, which is the one thing on the board
 * that is neither a body nor a palace but an answer about one.
 *
 * **What the sheet cannot gloss, it keys.** Two registers here carry no word
 * and cannot be given one where they stand: a 宿 sits in the rows above beside
 * its 入宿度, in a slot the width of a number, and a 次 heads a palace beside
 * the branch that names it. Both take a ringed numeral instead, and the band
 * under the ring says the name, the reading and the word against that numeral
 * — the same lookup 紫微斗數 keys its seats with, at the same size, so a reader
 * carrying the habit from one board finds it works on the other. The 人事宮 in
 * the foot of a palace is keyed for the opposite reason: there the word is all
 * that is printed, and the key is how a reader gets from it back to 兄弟宮.
 *
 * **The eleven are keyed in the ring and not in the rows.** A key earns its
 * room where a glyph stands with no word beside it, and in the rows the word
 * is already there — while the room it would take there comes straight out of
 * that word, which is the one thing on a row that shrinks to what it is
 * given. «la testa dell'eclissi» set at two thirds of the gloss beside it
 * would be the drawing paying for a shortcut with the thing the shortcut
 * leads to. In a palace there is room and no word, so that is where it goes.
 *
 * Like the other two it holds no catalog and knows no language. Words arrive
 * already chosen.
