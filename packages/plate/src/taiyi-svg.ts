/**
 * The 太乙 board: nine palaces with an empty middle, and sixteen seats round them.
 *
 * **It is a grid and not a ring, and that is the whole of the drawing's
 * argument.** The eight 宮 of this board *are* the nine palaces of a Qi Men
 * chart less the middle one, in the same 洛書 arrangement of directions — so
 * laying them as a circle would say they were the ring 六壬 and 七政四餘
 * share, which they are not, and a reader who had just looked at a chart would
 * learn a false thing about both figures at once.
 *
 * **The middle stays empty and the emptiness is content.** 太乙不入中宮: it
 * walks eight and never nine, and a centre filled with anything at all would
 * be the drawing answering a question the method refuses.
 *
 * The sixteen fall out of the geometry exactly. A five by five has sixteen
 * border cells and a three by three inside it; the four corners of that border
 * land on the four corner trigrams, and the four edge-middles on 子午卯酉,
 * which is precisely where 卷二 seats them. Nothing is squeezed to fit.
 *
 * **The numbers written in the palaces are this board's own.** 卷二 shifts
 * every one of them a seat from the Luoshu so that 一 reaches 乾, so 一宮 here
 * is the north-west and not the north. The drawing places a palace by the
 * direction it is handed and never by its number, so a figure that looks like
 * a chart cannot quietly be laid out like one; and a line under the grid says
 * so to the reader, because the picture cannot.
 *
 * **Every cell is tinted by its phase, and every name in one is glossed.** The
 * board is drawn at the measure of a page rather than of a column, so a cell
 * has room for a second line under the name — and what goes in it is the word
 * in the reader's language, as it is in every other drawing here. The reading
 * is not what belongs there: 太蔟 tàicù under a glyph tells a reader who does
 * not read Chinese how to *say* a thing they still cannot place, where «la
 * grande adunata» tells them what it is. The readings are said all together in
 * the band under the grid, which is the one lookup that stays a lookup.
 *
 * **The five that stand in the palaces are glossed too, and they were the
 * hole in that rule.** Sixteen names on the border carried their word and
 * 太乙 itself, with the four generals, stood in the squares as bare glyphs —
 * so the one part of this figure that *moves* from year to year was the one
 * part a reader without Chinese could not read. The palaces have less room
 * than the border does, being crossed by a number as well, so a stack that
 * cannot hold its words at a legible size keeps the names and drops them.
 *
 * **The band is columned and keyed, on 紫微斗數's precedent.** Sixteen names
 * run as three long lines of `名 reading · 名 reading` were a paragraph to be
 * searched rather than a list to be scanned; in three columns they are found
 * by eye. The ringed numeral in the corner of a border cell is the way back:
 * a reader meeting 呂申 on the board has the glyph and nothing else, and
 * without the key the only road from the glyph to the band runs through the
 * reading, which is what they came to look up.
 *
 * The tint is the seat's own element, which 卷六 states for the ring and which
 * the eight palaces inherit from the seat each of them stands on: nothing here
 * is a phase this board's own text does not hand down. The middle is left the
 * colour of the paper, because it stands on no seat and has no element to
 * take.
 *
 * Like the other three it holds no catalog and knows no language. South is at
 * the top, as everywhere here.
