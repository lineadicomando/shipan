 * Builds the MCP server.

 * The instructions are the only thing a client always sees, so they carry
 * what no single tool description can: a place is looked up rather than
 * guessed, the current date comes from the server rather than from the model,
 * and — since six boards are offered and an agent handed six will call
 * several — one board is read, never two of one instant. The argument for
 * that last one is `docs/readings.md`; the line is here because the failure
 * it prevents happens on the first call, before anything has been read.
 *
 * What belongs to one board stays in that board's tool description. These
 * instructions had gone stale by naming two boards when there were six, so
 * `docs.test.ts` now asserts that every compute tool the server offers is
 * named here.

        'five of the eight spirits, the twelve 宮 of a 七政四餘 board are the ring a 六壬 ' +
        'general is seated on, and a 八字 IS the four pillars the others are built from. Where ' +
        'two of them agree it is frequently one fact printed twice, and reporting that as ' +
        'corroboration counts one datum as two. Choose the instrument before you cast, and do ' +
        'not merge two into one reading. No transmitted rule combines the 三式. ' +

        'compute tool for the board you chose. Dates and times are given in local clock time, ' +

        'and reports where in it a thing stands. Its answers carry a direction as well as an ' +
        'hour, and the direction is half of the answer: never report the hour alone. ' +
        'The server returns arrangements and relations only. It will tell you that a gate ' +
        'stands over a palace whose element it controls, and it will not tell you what that ' +
        'means. Interpretation, if the person asks for one, is yours — and so is the ' +
        'responsibility for it. ' +
        'EVERY BOARD IS LAID BY A SCHOOL, INCLUDING THE ONE NOBODY CHOSE. Under the pillars ' +
        'of every answer there is a block naming each divergence in force and the value it ' +
        'stands on — the default included, because whoever chose nothing is exactly who does ' +
        'not know a choice was made for them. Say which school laid the board you are ' +
        'reporting, and that another exists. And do not lay one board twice under two schools ' +
        'and report their agreement: two schools of one art share nearly everything they are ' +
        'made of, so where they agree is the part neither disputed. ' +
        'Qi Men charts are cast by the chaibu method unless the method parameter chooses ' +
        'zhirun or maoshan; the three are different schools and lay out different charts from ' +
        'the same instant — chaibu and maoshan disagree about three hours in five — so never ' +
        'switch method between charts you are comparing. Every other board has divergences of ' +
        'its own with a declared default, and each names them in its own tool — where an ' +
        'argument is bare because a tool answers for one board, except where a board and the ' +
        'layer under it want the same word: `year_boundary` is where the four pillars are cut, ' +
